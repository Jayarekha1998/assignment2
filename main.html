									 HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language.
									 Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. 
									A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages.

									 CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.<br><br>
There are three types of CSS which are given below:<br></span>
									
									<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
									 <li>Inline CSS : <br>In Inline CSS, we add the style to the tags using the “style” attribute inside the tag which we want to design</li>
									 <li>Internal or Embedded CSS: <br>Internal CSS allows us to style our page by adding the &ltstyle&gt tag inside the <head> tag. Inside the &ltstyle&gt tag, we add the design that we want to give to our page.</li>
									 <li>External CSS : <br>External CSS lets us add style to our HTML page externally. We can add our styles in a different file with extension .css and link this page to our HTML page.</li>

									Intrduction To JavaScript	
								</a>
							</li>	
								<p style="font-size:30px">
								JavaScript is the world most popular lightweight, interpreted compiled programming language. It is also known as scripting language for web pages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. 
								JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments.<br><br>
								JavaScript can be added to your HTML file in two ways:<br><br>
								<b>Internal JS:</b> We can add JavaScript directly to our HTML file by writing the code inside the &ltscript&gt tag. The &ltscript&gttag can either be placed inside the &lthead&gt or the &ltbody&gt tag according to the requirement.<br><br>
								<b>External JS:</b> We can write JavaScript code in other file having an extension .js and then link this file inside the &lthead&gt tag of the HTML file in which we want to add this code.

									What can we build using JavaScript ?
								</a>
							</li>	
								<p style="font-size:30px">
JavaScript is the most popular and hence the most loved language around the globe. Apart from this, there are abundant reasons to learn it. Below are a listing of few important points:<br><br>

<b>No need of compilers:</b> Since JavaScript is an interpreted language, therefore it does not need any compiler for compilations.<br>
<b>Used both Client and Server-side:</b> Earlier JavaScript was used to build client-side applications only, but with the evolution of its frameworks namely Node.js and Express.js, it is now widely used for building server-side applications too.<br>
<b>Helps to build a complete solution:</b> As we saw, JavaScript is widely used in both client and server-side applications, therefore it helps us to build an end-to-end solution to a given problem.<br>
<b>Used everywhere:</b> JavaScript is so loved because it can be used anywhere. It can be used to develop websites, games or mobile apps, etc.<br>
<b.Huge community support:</b> JavaScript has a huge community of users and mentors who love this language and take it’s legacy forward.<br>

									Sql basic Commands
								</a>
							</li>	
									<p style="font-size:30px">SQL stands for Structured Query Language. 
									A query language is a kind of programming language that's designed to facilitate retrieving specific information from databases, 
									and that's exactly what SQL does. To put it simply, SQL is the language of databases.<br><br>
									Types of SQL Commands
The following sections discuss the basic categories of commands used in SQL to perform various functions. These functions include building database objects, manipulating objects, populating database tables with data, updating existing data in tables, deleting data, performing database queries, controlling database access, and overall database administration.

The main categories are:<br>

1.DDL (Data Definition Language)<br>
2.DML (Data Manipulation Language)<br>
3.DQL (Data Query Language)<br>
4.DCL (Data Control Language)<br>
5.Transactional control commands<br>

									About Php
								</a>
							</li>	
									<p style="font-size:30px">
										PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. 
									Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.<br>
										
											1.PHP is a recursive acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor".<br><br>
											2.PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.<br><br>
											3.It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.<br><br>
											4.PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.<br><br>
											5.PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.<br><br>
											6.PHP is forgiving: PHP language tries to be as forgiving as possible.<br>
											7.PHP Syntax is C-Like.
